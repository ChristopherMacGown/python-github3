THIS IS NOT YET FINISHED, DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION, THIS IS NOT A BANANA.
I WILL BE CHANGING HOW YOU INTERACT WITH THE CLIENT. THERE WILL BE SEARCH STUFF
ADDED TO THE HANDLERS. PYLINT CLEANUPS ARE FORTHCOMING, AUTHENTICATION IS
FORTHCOMING, MORE TESTS ARE FORTHCOMING.


To use:


from github3 import client


c = client.Client(username="blah", auth_token="BLAH")
issues = c.issues("github_username_of_repo", "repo").list()
issue = c.issues("github_username_of_repo", "repo").show(12345)


Deletes don't work, creates don't work, updates don't work, auth doesn't work.
